# Rust & ZK Learning Journey 🦀

This repository tracks my progress as a math student, moving from Rust fundamentals to arithmetization, STARK-based zkVMs (SP1), and post-quantum cryptographic primitives.

## Current Focus

* Understanding algebraic proof systems and small fields optimization.
* Preparing for **Privacy Mixer SP1**: Developing a non-custodial privacy protocol by leveraging **Plonky3's field-agnostic arithmetization** for sub-second proving, combined with **recursive Groth16 wrapping** for on-chain verification efficiency.

## Future Research
* **Advanced Lookup Arguments**: Deep diving into **Lasso** to understand how it generalizes the Sum-check protocol to provide ultra-efficient lookups without the overhead of traditional STARK-based tables.
* **Jolt Instruction Set**: Studying the shift from traditional R1CS/Plonkish circuits towards Jolt’s architecture, where the prover’s work is dominated by Sum-check and MLE (Multilinear Extensions).
